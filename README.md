# Mockingbird-E-M-Type-2-Trunk-Card Firmware

This firmware is designed to be used with the E&M card in the Mockingbird Telephone Exchange.

The Mockingbird telephone exchange is a suite of hardware and firmware projects to emulate the way American analog telepone switches sounded and worked in the 20th century.


Features: 
* Written with platformio and the Arduino framework.
* STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller.
* Handles I2C communication with the main microcontroller
* State machines for originating and terminating calls over an E&M type 2 trunk.
* Designed to run on the associated E&M trunk card design (See hackaday.io link below).
